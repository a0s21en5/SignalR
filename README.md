# SignalR
RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker software that provides a messaging system for applications to communicate with each other. It implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and is written in the Erlang programming language. RabbitMQ enables different components of an application to exchange messages asynchronously, decoupling the sender and receiver, and ensuring reliable delivery.


## RabbitMQ Key Concepts

- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ acts as a mediator between different components of an application, allowing them to send and receive messages.

- **Producer**: A producer is an application or component that sends messages to RabbitMQ for further processing or delivery.

- **Consumer**: A consumer is an application or component that receives messages from RabbitMQ and processes them.

- **Exchange**: An exchange is responsible for receiving messages from producers and routing them to the appropriate queues based on specific rules, known as bindings.

- **Queue**: A queue is a buffer that holds messages until they are consumed by a consumer. Messages are delivered to queues based on routing rules defined by exchanges.

- **Binding**: A binding is a link between an exchange and a queue that defines the routing rules for delivering messages. It specifies how messages should be distributed based on criteria such as routing keys or message headers.

- **Routing Key**: A routing key is a value associated with a message that is used by exchanges to determine which queues should receive the message.

- **Acknowledgment**: RabbitMQ provides an acknowledgment mechanism to ensure reliable message delivery. Consumers can acknowledge the receipt of a message once it has been successfully processed. If a message is not acknowledged within a certain timeframe, RabbitMQ can re-queue it for redelivery.

## To use RabbitMQ in an ASP.NET Core application,

```
dotnet add package RabbitMQ.Client
```
